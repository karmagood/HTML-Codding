        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>This specification defines the 5th major version, second minor revision of the core language of the World
            Wide Web: the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). In this version, new features continue to be introduced to
            help Web application authors, new elements continue to be introduced based on research into prevailing
            authoring practices, and special attention continues to be given to defining clear conformance criteria for
            user agents in an effort to improve interoperability.</p>

        <h3>Status of this document</h3>
        <p>

            This section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication. Other documents may
            supersede this document. A list of current W3C publications and the latest revision of this technical report
            can be found in the W3C technical reports index at https://www.w3.org/TR/.

            This document was published by the Web Platform Working Group as a Candidate Recommendation for HTML 5.2,
            reflecting the "leading edge" of what is interoperably deployed as HTML. This document is intended to become
            a W3C Recommendation.

            Features which are shown not to have implementation may be removed from this specification.

            The following features are explicitly "at risk" and unless testing during Candidate Recommendation
            demonstrates interoperable implementation of each feature it will be removed, per W3C Process - 6.4
            Candidate Recommendation:

            The input/inputmode attribute for input elements
            The menu and menuitem elements
            The allow-presentation sanboxing flag for the sandbox attribute of an iframe
            The dialog element
            The datetime state for the input element
            The plugin API

            If you wish to make comments regarding this document, please send them to this specification's GitHub
            repository or public mailing list public-html@w3.org (archived, see instructions). When sending e-mail,
            please put the text “html” in the subject, preferably like this: “[html] …summary of comment…“. All comments
            are welcome.

            The Working Group expects to demonstrate 2 implementations of the features listed in this specification by
            the end of the Candidate Recommendation phase. An implementation report will be produced for this version to
            demonstrate that in almost every case changes are matched by interoperable implementation.

            W3C publishes a Candidate Recommendation to indicate that the document is believed to be stable and to
            encourage implementation by the developer community. This Candidate Recommendation is expected to advance to
            Proposed Recommendation no earlier than 5 September 2017.

            Publication as a Candidate Recommendation does not imply endorsement by the W3C Membership. This is a draft
            document and may be updated, replaced or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to
            cite this document as other than work in progress.

            This document was produced by a group operating under the 5 February 2004 W3C Patent Policy. W3C maintains a
            public list of any patent disclosures made in connection with the deliverables of the group; that page also
            includes instructions for disclosing a patent. An individual who has actual knowledge of a patent which the
            individual believes contains Essential Claim(s) must disclose the information in accordance with section 6
            of the W3C Patent Policy.

            This document is governed by the 1 March 2017 W3C Process Document.
